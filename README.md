Conclusions

Time series analysis

Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

Based on the time series analysis, for the ARIMA model, I would buy the yen, for a 5 day forecasting the price of the yen is predicted to grow. Based on the the ARMA model I wouldn't buy, since the projection shows that the price will drop, for  a 5 day forecasting.

Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

According to the GARCH volatility forecasting the risk of the yen is expected to increase when we see values calculated for our forecast horizon. The forecastig shows that for 5 days time horizon the volatility will be incremental from day to day.

Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?

Since for both ARMA and ARIMA models the P>|z| values are way bigger than 0.05, the predictions could have been generated by a random process, in wich case I wouldn't recommend making a decision of whether to buy or not yens based on the forecasting of this models.

Conclusions

Reggresion Analysis

Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?

The out of sample performance was better than the in sample, because the Root Mean Squared Error of the out of sample data is lower. 0.4152 < 0.5658. Meaning that the difference between values observed and predicted is lower.
